# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Paseo is a mobile app for monitoring and controlling your local AI coding agents from anywhere. Your dev environment, in your pocket.

**Key features:**
- Real-time streaming of agent output
- Voice commands for hands-free interaction
- Push notifications when tasks complete
- Multi-agent orchestration across projects

**Not a cloud sandbox** - Paseo connects directly to your actual development environment. Your code stays on your machine.

**Supported agents:** Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Monorepo Structure

This is an npm workspace monorepo:

- **packages/server**: The Paseo daemon that runs on your machine. Manages agent processes, provides WebSocket API for real-time streaming, and exposes an MCP server for agent control.
- **packages/app**: Cross-platform client (Expo). Connects to one or more servers, displays agent output, handles voice input, and sends push notifications.
- **packages/cli**: The `paseo` CLI that is used to manage the deamon, and acts as a client to it with  Docker-style commands like `paseo run/ls/logs/wait`
- **packages/website**: Marketing site at paseo.sh (TanStack Router + Cloudflare Workers).

## Development Server

The `npm run dev` script automatically picks an available port for the development server.

When running in a worktree or alongside the main checkout, set `PASEO_HOME` to isolate state:

```bash
PASEO_HOME=~/.paseo-blue npm run dev
```

- `PASEO_HOME` – path for runtime state (agent data, sockets, etc.). Defaults to `~/.paseo`; set this to a unique directory when running a secondary server instance.

For trace+ logs, check $PASEO_HOME/daemon.log

## Running and checking logs

Both the server and Expo app are running in a Tmux session. See CLAUDE.local.md for system-specific session details.

## Debugging

### Daemon and CLI

The Paseo daemon communicates via WebSocket. In the main checkout:
- Daemon runs at `localhost:6767`
- Expo app at `localhost:8081`
- State lives in `$PASEO_HOME`

In worktrees or when running `npm run dev`, ports and home directories may differ. Never assume the defaults.

Use `npm run cli` to run the local CLI (instead of the globally linked `paseo` which points to the main checkout). Always run `npm run cli -- --help` or load the `/paseo` skill before using it - do not guess commands.

Use `--host <host:port>` to point the CLI at a different daemon (e.g., `--host localhost:7777`).

### Relay build sync (important)

When changing `packages/relay/src/*`, rebuild relay before running/debugging the daemon:

```bash
npm run build --workspace=@getpaseo/relay
```

Reason: Node daemon imports `@getpaseo/relay` from `packages/relay/dist/*` (`node` export path), not directly from `src/*`.

### Server build sync for CLI (important)

When changing `packages/server/src/client/*` (especially `daemon-client.ts`) or shared WS protocol types, rebuild server before running/debugging CLI commands:

```bash
npm run build --workspace=@getpaseo/server
```

Reason: local CLI imports `@getpaseo/server` via package exports that resolve to `packages/server/dist/*` first. If `dist` is stale, CLI can speak an old protocol (for example, sending `session` before `hello`) and fail with handshake warnings/timeouts.

### Quick reference CLI commands

```bash
npm run cli -- ls -a -g              # List all agents globally
npm run cli -- ls -a -g --json       # Same, as JSON
npm run cli -- inspect <id>          # Show detailed agent info
npm run cli -- logs <id>             # View agent timeline
npm run cli -- daemon status         # Check daemon status
```

### Agent state

Agent data is stored at:
```
$PASEO_HOME/agents/{cwd-with-dashes}/{agent-id}.json
```

To find an agent by ID:
```bash
find $PASEO_HOME/agents -name "{agent-id}.json"
```

To find an agent by title or other content:
```bash
rg -l "some title text" $PASEO_HOME/agents/
rg -l "spiteful-toad" $PASEO_HOME/agents/
```

### Provider session files

Get the session ID from the agent JSON file (`persistence.sessionId`), then:

**Claude sessions:**
```
~/.claude/projects/{cwd-with-dashes}/{session-id}.jsonl
```

**Codex sessions:**
```
~/.codex/sessions/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/rollout-{timestamp}-{session-id}.jsonl
```

## Android

Take screenshots like this: `adb exec-out screencap -p > screenshot.png`

### Android variants (vanilla Expo)

Use `APP_VARIANT` in `packages/app/app.config.js` to control app name + package ID (no custom Gradle flavor plugin):

- `production` -> app name `Paseo`, package `sh.paseo`
- `development` -> app name `Paseo Debug`, package `sh.paseo.debug`

EAS profiles live in `packages/app/eas.json` as `development`, `production`, and `production-apk`.

`development` uses Android `debug`.

### Local build + install (Android device)

From `packages/app`:

```bash
# development (debug)
APP_VARIANT=development npx expo prebuild --platform android --non-interactive
APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:android --variant=debug

# production (release)
APP_VARIANT=production npx expo prebuild --platform android --non-interactive
APP_VARIANT=production npx expo run:android --variant=release

# clean native project (when needed)
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean --non-interactive
```

From repo root:

```bash
npm run android:development
npm run android:production
npm run android:clean
```

`npm run android:release` is an alias for `npm run android:production`.

### Cloud build + submit (EAS Workflows)

Tag pushes like `v0.1.0` trigger `packages/app/.eas/workflows/release-mobile.yml` on Expo servers.
Tag pushes like `v0.1.0` also trigger `.github/workflows/android-apk-release.yml` on GitHub Actions to publish an APK asset on the matching GitHub Release.

That workflow does:
- Build iOS with the `production` profile
- Build Android with the `production` profile
- Submit each build with the `production` submit profile

Useful commands:

```bash
# List recent mobile workflow runs
cd packages/app && npx eas workflow:runs --workflow release-mobile.yml --limit 10

# Inspect one run (jobs, status, outputs)
cd packages/app && npx eas workflow:view <run-id>

# Stream logs for all steps in one failed job
cd packages/app && npx eas workflow:logs <job-id> --non-interactive --all-steps
```

## Testing with Playwright MCP

**CRITICAL:** When asked to test the app, you MUST use the Playwright MCP connecting to Metro at `http://localhost:8081`.

Use the Playwright MCP to test the app in Metro web. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081` to interact with the app UI.

**Important:** Do NOT use browser history (back/forward). Always navigate by clicking UI elements or using `browser_navigate` with the full URL. The app uses client-side routing and browser history navigation breaks the state.

## Expo troubleshooting

Run `npx expo-doctor` to diagnose version mismatches and native module issues.

## Release playbook

Use the scripted release flow from repo root. Avoid manual version bumps, manual tags, or ad hoc publish commands unless debugging.

```bash
# Recommended: full patch release (bump, check, publish, push branch+tag)
npm run release:patch

# Manual, step-by-step fallback:
npm run version:all:patch  # npm version across all workspaces (creates commit + local tag)
npm run release:check
npm run release:publish
npm run release:push       # pushes HEAD and current version tag (triggers desktop + Android APK + EAS mobile workflows)
```

Notes:
- `version:all:*` bumps the root package version and runs the root `version` lifecycle script to sync workspace versions and internal `@getpaseo/*` dependency versions before the release commit/tag is created.
- `release:prepare` refreshes workspace `node_modules` links to prevent stale local package types during release checks.
- If `release:publish` fails after a successful publish of one workspace, re-run `npm run release:publish`; npm will skip already-published versions and continue where possible.
- If a user asks to "release paseo" (without specifying major/minor), treat it as a patch release and run `npm run release:patch`.
- All workspaces share one version by design. Keep versions synchronized and release together.
- The website Mac download CTA URL is derived from `packages/website/package.json` version at build time, so no manual update is required after release.

Release completion checklist:
- Manually update CHANGELOG.md with release notes, between current release vs previous one, use Git commands to figure out what changed. The notes are user-facing:
    - Ask yourself, what do Paseo users want to know about?
    - Include: New features, bug fixes
    - Don't include: Refactors or code changes that are not noticeable by users
- `npm run release:patch` completes successfully.
- GitHub `Desktop Release` workflow for the new `v*` tag is green.
- GitHub `Android APK Release` workflow for the same tag is green.
- EAS `release-mobile.yml` workflow for the same tag is green (Expo queues can take longer on the free plan).

## Orchestrator Mode

- **When agent control tool calls fail**, make sure you list agents before trying to launch another one. It could just be a wait timeout.
- **Always prefix agent titles** so we can tell which ones are running under you (e.g., "🎭 Feature Implementation", "🎭 Design Discussion").
- **Launch agents in the most permissive mode**: Use full access or bypass permissions mode.
- **Set cwd to the repository root** - The agent's working directory should usually be the repo root

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS RUN TYPECHECK AFTER EVERY CHANGE.**

## Agent Authentication

All agent providers (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) handle their own authentication outside of environment variables. They are authenticated without providing any extra configuration—Paseo does not manage API keys or tokens for agents.

**Do not add auth checks to tests.** If auth fails for whatever reason, let the user know instead of patching the code or adding conditional skips.

## NEVER DO THESE THINGS

- **NEVER restart the main Paseo daemon on port 6767 without permission** - This is the production daemon that launches and manages agents. If you are reading this, you are probably running as an agent under it. Restarting it will kill your own process and all other running agents. The daemon is managed by the user in Tmux.
- **NEVER assume a timeout means the service needs restarting** - Timeouts can be transient network issues, not service failures
- **NEVER add authentication checks to tests** - Agent providers handle their own auth. If tests fail due to auth issues, report it rather than adding conditional skips or env var checks
